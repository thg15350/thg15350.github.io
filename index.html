Collectively, UGA has 17 different colleges with 140 different majors and anyone could find a major or college that interests them. UGA also has 2 satellite campuses located in Tifton, Georgia and Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia is home to many student organizations such as:</p>	<ul style="color:darkred;">		<li>Student Athletics</li>		<li>Greek Life</li>		<li>Reserve Office Training Corps</li>		<li>Student Government Association</li>		<li>Student Media</li>	</ul>	<h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration: underline">UGA Athletics</h2> <p style="color:darkred">The University of Georgia has an Athletic program that brings fans in from all over Georgia and the surrounding states. The Bulldawg football program attracts over <del> 70,000 </del>90,000 people to Sanford Stadium. Other athletic programs that UGA offers does not quite get the same amount of attention as football but they are still very competitive and skilled. Many athletes are heavily involved on campus in other organizations or groups. Most athletes live on campus because that is part of their scholarships for the school.</p> <table border=1 style="margin: 0px auto;text-align:center">	<tr>		<th>Athletic Program</th><th>Football</th><th>Equestrian</th><th>Swimming</th><th>Gymnastics</th><th>Tennis</th>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Male or Female</td><td>Male</td><td>Both</td><td>Female</td><td>Female</td><td>Both</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Number of SEC Championships</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>13</td>	</tr></table>	<h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration: underline"> Greek Life </h2> <p style="color:darkred">Greek life at UGA is the number 1 attraction to new freshman that are coming to the campus. With over 30 fraternities and sororities anyone can find somewhere that they fit in. Fraternities and sororities are often casted in a negative light, but no one recognizes the amount of money they raise through philanthropies or how they benefit the surrounding city. Some of the organizations have been on campus almost as long as the university itself. It would be a lie to say that fraternities and sororities have not been busted in the past for drugs, alcohol, and hazing. Lately, Pi Kappa Phi has been suspended for a year following hazing and alcohol related incidents. Last year, Delta Sigma Phi was caught for hazing pledges by putting them in trash cans full of ice water until they could recite the creed.
